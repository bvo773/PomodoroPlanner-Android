Plan-t a Pomodoro is an app that builds off the Pomodoro method’s philosophy. The objective is to achieve more with less, but also move through tasks quickly and consistently. The reduced complexity lets users focus solely on their efforts in their activities. 

The project is aimed to build an app that implements the Pomodoro Technique in a two semesters development cycle. The app will be built on Android with the goal to satisfy users through the stages of planning, visualizing, tracking and recording. Designs and features/components of the app will be implemented in XML and Java in Android Studio. Open Libraries such as Graphview and JSoup use for graph plotting and parsing website’s data. Backend service will be provided by Google Cloud-Based API Firebase to handle user’s authentication and app’s data.
